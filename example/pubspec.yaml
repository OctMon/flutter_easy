  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
